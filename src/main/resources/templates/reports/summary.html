 students, ${numGreek} students volunteered with their greek organization,
 with ${topGreek} being the greek organization which contributed the most
 volunteers this year.
</p> 
<p>Out of ${numStudentsVol} students, ${numClub} volunteered with a club. 
${topClub} contributed the most volunteers this year. ${numLoners} students were
not associated with a greek organization or club.
