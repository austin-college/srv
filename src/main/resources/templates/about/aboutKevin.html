My name is ${name} and I'm a ${class} graduating from Austin College (hopefully) this May. I'm ${age} years old 
and ready to join the workforce in any way shape or form. I'm most interested in full stack web development but cyber 
security has always interested me. I'm a fan of both the indoors and outdoors and enjoy playing video games, fishing, hiking, and cooking.
