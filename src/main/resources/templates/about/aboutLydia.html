My name is ${name} and I am graduating from Austin College this semester. My major is ${major}
and my minor is ${minor}. <br> My plans for after graduation are to find a job somewhere in the Dallas area 
and study for the GRE to get into graduate school. My hobbies include <br>hiking, reading, and playing 
video games, but my main hobby is ${hobby}. I have been taking ${hobby} on and off since 2010 but have 
really <br> committed to the sport in the last 4 years. I have competed in AOK tournaments and went to the Texas 
State championships in 2017. This last summer <br> I received my 2<sup>nd</sup> degree black belt, my top accomplishment in 
life thus far. I now help instruct classes every ${workday} night. My dream job is to <br> work for the
United States Department of Defense or NASA.
